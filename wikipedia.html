            <b>The Mongol Empire</b> of the 13th and 14th centuries was the largest contiguous land empire in
            history.[2]
            Originating in Mongolia in East Asia, the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Eastern Europe and parts
            of
            Central Europe to the Sea of Japan, extending northward into parts of the Arctic;[3] eastward and southward
            into
            the Indian subcontinent, Mainland Southeast Asia and the Iranian Plateau; and westward as far as the Levant
            and
            the Carpathian Mountains.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of several nomadic tribes in the Mongol homeland under the
            leadership of Genghis Khan (c.  1162–1227), whom a council proclaimed as the ruler of all Mongols in 1206.
            The
            empire grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants, who sent out invading armies in every
            direction.[4][5] The vast transcontinental empire connected the East with the West, the Pacific to the
            Mediterranean, in an enforced Pax Mongolica, allowing the dissemination and exchange of trade, technologies,
            commodities and ideologies across Eurasia.[6][7]
            The empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether
            the
            royal line should follow from his son and initial heir Ögedei or from one of his other sons, such as Tolui,
            Chagatai, or Jochi. The Toluids prevailed after a bloody purge of Ögedeid and Chagataid factions, but
            disputes
            continued among the descendants of Tolui. A key reason for the split was the dispute over whether the Mongol
            Empire would become a sedentary, cosmopolitan empire, or would stay true to the Mongol nomadic and
            steppe-based
            lifestyle. After Möngke Khan died (1259), rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different
            successors,
            the brothers Ariq Böke and Kublai Khan, who fought each other in the Toluid Civil War (1260–1264) and also
            dealt
            with challenges from the descendants of other sons of Genghis.[8][9] Kublai successfully took power, but
            civil
            war ensued as he sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chagatayid and Ögedeid families.

        <h2>Name</h2>
        <p>What is referred to in English as the Mongol Empire was called the ᠶᠡᠬᠡ
            ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ
            ᠤᠯᠤᠰ Ikh Mongol Uls (ikh: "great", uls: "state"; Great Mongolian State).[13][14] In the 1240s, one of
            Genghis's
            descendants, Güyük Khan, wrote a letter to Pope Innocent IV which used the preamble "Dalai (great/oceanic)
            Khagan of the great Mongolian state (ulus)".[15]

            After the succession war between Kublai Khan and his brother Ariq Böke, Ariq limited Kublai's power to the
            eastern part of the empire. Kublai officially issued an imperial edict on 18 December 1271 to name the
            country
            Great Yuan (Dai Yuan, or Dai Ön Ulus) to establish the Yuan dynasty. Some sources state that the full
            Mongolian
            name was Dai Ön Yehe Monggul Ulus.[16]

        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Pre-empire context</h3>
        <p>The area around Mongolia, Manchuria, and parts of North China had been controlled by the Liao dynasty since
            the
            10th century. In 1125, the Jin dynasty founded by the Jurchens overthrew the Liao dynasty and attempted to
            gain
            control over former Liao territory in Mongolia. In the 1130s the Jin dynasty rulers, known as the Golden
            Kings,
            successfully resisted the Khamag Mongol confederation, ruled at the time by Khabul Khan, great-grandfather
            of
            Genghis Khan.[17]

            The Mongolian plateau was occupied mainly by five powerful tribal confederations (khanlig): Keraites, Khamag
            Mongol, Naiman, Mergid, and Tatar. The Jin emperors, following a policy of divide and rule, encouraged
            disputes
            among the tribes, especially between the Tatars and the Mongols, in order to keep the nomadic tribes
            distracted
            by their own battles and thereby away from the Jin. Khabul's successor was Ambaghai Khan, who was betrayed
            by
            the Tatars, handed over to the Jurchen, and executed. The Mongols retaliated by raiding the frontier,
            resulting
            in a failed Jurchen counter-attack in 1143.[17]

            In 1147, the Jin somewhat changed their policy, signing a peace treaty with the Mongols and withdrawing from
            a
            score of forts. The Mongols then resumed attacks on the Tatars to avenge the death of their late khan,
            opening a
            long period of active hostilities. The Jin and Tatar armies defeated the Mongols in 1161.[17]

            During the rise of the Mongol Empire in the 13th century, the usually cold, parched steppes of Central Asia
            enjoyed their mildest, wettest conditions in more than a millennium. It is thought that this resulted in a
            rapid
            increase in the number of war horses and other livestock, which significantly enhanced Mongol military
            strength.[18]
